# Traffic-Signal-detection-Model
Developed a traffic sign detection model using YOLOv9. Created a custom dataset by capturing and labeling traffic sign images, enhancing it with data augmentation and preprocessing. The YOLOv9 model was optimized and rigorously evaluated, achieving high accuracy. This project highlights skills in data handling, model development, and evaluation.
